# Code Standards

## Clean Code Principles
- Follow Robert C. Martin's Clean Code principles throughout
- Write short functions (3-5 lines long)
- Create descriptive function names that clearly express intent
- Avoid comments in code - code should be self-documenting
- Follow single responsibility principle

## Programming Approach
- Use functional programming approaches where possible
- Maintain appropriate levels of abstraction within functions/classes
- Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
- TDD means write a one test at a time, run the tests to ensure they fail and then wrote the code to pass.

## Technology Stack
- Place all terminal commands in a makefile
- Run terminal commands yourself
- Application must be written in Python
- Follow Python's PEP 8 style guide
- Use Python standard libraries where applicable before introducing dependencies

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling for all API calls
- Ensure failures are gracefully managed, especially for Jira integration

## Documentation
- Documentation should be clear, concise, and accurate
- Focus documentation on how to use features, not implementation details
