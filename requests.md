Please create a specification.md markdown file. It must contain a specification for a model context protocol server for me to use with Claude desktop. The purpose of this mcp server is to help Claude run a Dungeons and Dragons Game as a Dungeon Master. The first feature is a set of mcp tools to save, search and retrieve high level campaign information. Please use a sqllite database to easily save and search json objects. Please include BDD style feature files to test this mcp server. This specification file must include the design for the mcp server, the technologies, the folder structure, etc. Don't write any code yet. Please include the specification in a file called specification.md. Refer to the mcp-python_sdk.md file for the mcp specification. I want to use python for this. Please refer the documentation in the github repository at https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/tree/main. Do not include any features beyong high level campaign information.

Please create the mcp server from the specification file. Please refer the documentation in the github repository at https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/tree/main especially the readme.md file. Use the guidance from the python-sdk-readme.md file as a guide to create the mcp server. Pay attention to the folder structure and the file names in the specification file.

Please add the character management features to the mcp server called dm.py. Pay attention to the folder structure and the file names in the specification file. Include the character management scenarios from the specification file in the tests folder.
