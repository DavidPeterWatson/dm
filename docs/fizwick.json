      "backstory": "Fizwick grew up in a small gnomish enclave deep within the Neverwinter Wood, where ancient magic permeates the very soil. From an early age, he displayed an uncanny ability to remember everything he read, coupled with a curious nature that often got him into trouble. As a young gnome, Fizwick discovered the ruins of an ancient elven library that had been abandoned for centuries. There, he found a sentient magical quill that would become his most prized possession and the catalyst for his arcane studies. The quill, which he named 'Inkwhisper,' seemed to have a personality of its own and would occasionally guide his hand to write in languages he didn't understand. Fizwick spent years cataloging and studying the tomes in the hidden library, eventually catching the attention of a traveling wizard from Neverwinter who recognized his potential. The wizard brought him to the city to study at the prestigious School of Magic, where Fizwick excelled in the theoretical aspects of spellcasting but often found practical applications more challenging due to his excitable nature. Recently, Fizwick received a cryptic message through Inkwhisper, showing symbols that match markings he had seen in the deeper parts of Neverwinter Wood. Convinced that there is a greater repository of knowledge waiting to be discovered, he has set out to uncover these secrets, hoping to learn more about the origins of his magical quill and the ancient elven civilization that created it.",
